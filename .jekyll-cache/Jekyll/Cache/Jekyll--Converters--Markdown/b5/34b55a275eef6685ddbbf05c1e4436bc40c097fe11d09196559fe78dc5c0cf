<p>Our desired goal is that the player will feel adventurous as he goes through the story while feeling delighted over the many details in the game. We added a problem solving aspect to the game to challenge the player and make him feel accomplished when he finds the colors. While the story keeps players interested, they should also feel creative as their actions have effect on how colors appear in the world.</p>
