The Starborne Dissidence update is finally here!
With that update comes so many cool things like the new and improved **Politics panel**.

When mentioning the politics panel, what goes into that is actually 6 sub-panels _(and 3 sub-sub panels, but who's counting)_. I was responsible for the UI implementation of these panels. Though most of the work was client-side, some work was needed on the server for alliance definitions to fit the new design.

### Description

Politics are an essential part of the Starborne gameplay. The panels have all the information you might need on players, alliances and rankings. While the panels are some of the most used panels in the game, they were also some of the oldest so it was about time to give them a makeover.

_What's new with this design:_
* Memos, instead of message of the day
* Easier navigation with map pins and alliance operations
* Alliance Crests

#### Here are screenshots of some of my favorite panels on the new server:

This is one of the biggest projects I have taken on so far since starting working for Solid Clouds and I am very happy with the result. You can download the game at [starborne.com](https://starborne.com/) if you want to check it out.
