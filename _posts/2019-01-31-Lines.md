Game I made in the course SC-T-634-AGDD Advanced Game Design & Development at the University of Reykjav√≠k.

## Description
This minimalistic puzzle game has a simple goal, get the other dot.

## Development
The game was created using Unity/C#.

The theme was minimal and I went right for the core of minimlism in shapes, colors and gameplay.
The primary goal was to make the game visually pleasing and relaxing while evoking some emotions.

When testing the game I realized I failed completly because people got really frustrated and mad. 
The game is very unforgiving and people did not think it was relaxing at all (but I kind of still like it like that).
