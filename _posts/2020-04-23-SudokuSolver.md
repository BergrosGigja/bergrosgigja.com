While thinking of a project that could freshen up my python knowledge and also be game development related I stumbled on to the [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) website.

With Sudoku being one of my favorite classic games, I decided it would be more fun to create a sudoku solver instead of a puzzle to play.

By clicking the blank boxes, numbers go up from 1-9 and then back around. When the grid has been set up, the solve button can be clicked and the rest fills out.

Find it on github [here](https://github.com/BergrosGigja/Sudoku-solver).
