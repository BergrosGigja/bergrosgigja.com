title:        "Sandcastle Theme"
description:  "Simple blog/portfolio Jekyll Theme"
---

I recently discovered this phenomenon: Jekyll static site generator.
When I realized how long this has been a thing I also realized I may have been living under a rock.
I don't have much interest in web development and maybe that's why. 

Either way my hate for HTML/CSS and love for Markdown made me research this further.

I previously had a wix website but I wasn't a fan, I wanted something that cost less and I had more control. Having my site on github pages was also of course a huge plus.
I wanted to find a simple or minimalistic blog that could also double as a sort of portfolio.
After finding the [Kiko theme](https://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko) by [gfjaru](https://github.com/gfjaru) I forked it and started working on top of it.

The finished outcome is the [Sandcastle theme](https://bergrosgigja.github.io/Sandcastle/)
You can checkout the github page [here](https://github.com/BergrosGigja/Sandcastle).

_Some of the changes I made from the original:_
* Different font and item styles
* Use of colors that can be changed in the config
* Social media icons in footer
* Adding emojis.
