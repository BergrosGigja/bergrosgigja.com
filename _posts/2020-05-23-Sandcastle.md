description:  "Simple blog/portfolio Jekyll Theme"

I recently discovered this phenomenon: Jekyll static site generator.
I had a wix website but I was looking for something with less cost and simple to use.
My love for markdown made me research Jekyll further and I ended up really liking it.

I wanted to set up a simple or minimalistic blog or portfolio.
I didn't want to start from scratch, so I found a minimalistic theme to build on.
After finding the [Kiko theme](https://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko) by [gfjaru](https://github.com/gfjaru) I forked it and started working on top of it.

The finished outcome is the [Sandcastle theme](https://bergrosgigja.github.io/Sandcastle/)
You can checkout the github page [here](https://github.com/BergrosGigja/Sandcastle).

_Some of the changes I made from the original:_
* Different font and item styles
* Use of colors that can be changed in the config
* Social media icons in footer
* Adding emojis.
